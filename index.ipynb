Remember, in the case of assignment, the return value is `None`, which does not show an output. We can see this more concretely below by running the cell below:"

    "In this lesson, we learned about Jupyter notebooks.  We saw that in Jupyter notebooks, we can either be in insert mode or escape mode.  While in insert mode, we can edit the cells and undo changes within that cell with `cmd + z` on a mac or `ctl + z` on windows.  In escape mode, we can add cells with `b`, delete a cell with `x`, and undo deletion of a cell with `z`.  We can also change the type of a cell to markdown with `m` and to Python code with `y`.  \n",
